# BST Project
This program takes an input file `in.txt`, which contains a list of queries that fall under three types.
- Inserts Binary Search Trees (BSTs), referred to as "Name trees," into another BST
- Inserts items into the "Name trees." Each item additionally has a count
- Queries that perform operations and algorithms on the BSTs and the items within them.
# Project Constraints
The project required all the code to be written in one .cpp file AND to export the console output into an `out.txt` file.
